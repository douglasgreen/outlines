# Instructions

## Outline per chapter

Turn chapter X of this outline into an Audio Script following these instructions:

1. **Conversational Tone**: Write in a natural, spoken voice—clear, engaging, and friendly, as if explaining the material to a curious listener.

2. **Narrative Flow**: Follow the order of the outline, but shape it into a smooth, flowing explanation rather than a list of points.

3. **No Introductions or Music Cues**: Skip any audio stage directions. Just get straight into the material.

4. **Clarify and Expand**: Where the outline is brief, expand with examples, analogies, or short stories to make complex ideas easier to understand and more vivid.

5. **Short Paragraphs**: Break content into short, spoken-length chunks. Vary rhythm and sentence structure to keep the pace lively.

6. **Natural Transitions**: Use simple verbal transitions (e.g., “Now let’s look at...”, “So, what does this mean for you?”) to guide the listener between ideas smoothly.

7. **No Visual References**: Avoid relying on charts, diagrams, math, source code, or anything the listener can’t see. If needed, describe such content in simple, visual language.
