# Advanced PHP Programming: A Comprehensive Guide for Experienced Developers

## Chapter 1: Modern PHP Fundamentals

### PHP's Evolution and Current Landscape

PHP has evolved significantly since its inception in 1994, transforming from a simple set of tools to a robust programming language that powers a substantial portion of the web. Understanding this evolution provides context for modern PHP development practices and helps explain both its strengths and criticisms.

#### The Birth and Early Development of PHP

PHP began in 1994 as a creation of Rasmus Lerdorf, who developed a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) binaries written in C. Initially called "Personal Home Page Tools" (PHP Tools), it was designed to track visits to his online resume.

The early evolution of PHP happened in several distinct phases:

* **PHP/FI (1995-1997)**: After releasing the source code publicly in June 1995, Lerdorf briefly renamed it to FI (Forms Interpreter). By April 1996, he combined previous names to create PHP/FI 2.0, which included support for databases like mSQL and Postgres95, cookies, and user-defined functions.

* **Syntax in PHP/FI**: The early syntax was embedded in HTML comments, making it somewhat awkward but functional for simple dynamic web content.

```php
<!--include /text/header.html-->
<!--getenv HTTP_USER_AGENT-->
<!--ifsubstr $exec_result Mozilla-->
  Hey, you are using Netscape!<p>
<!--endif-->
```

By 1998, PHP/FI was installed on approximately 60,000 domains, representing about 1% of all domains on the internet at that time.

#### The Transformation: PHP 3 to PHP 5

The language underwent a significant transformation with PHP 3.0, developed by Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski in 1997. This version marked the beginning of PHP as we know it today:

* **PHP 3.0 (1998)**: Renamed to the recursive acronym "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor," this version introduced strong extensibility features, object-oriented programming support, and a more consistent language syntax.

* **PHP 4.0 (2000)**: Built on the new Zend Engine, PHP 4 significantly improved performance for complex applications and added features like HTTP sessions, output buffering, and more secure user input handling.

* **PHP 5.0 (2004)**: Powered by Zend Engine 2.0, this version introduced a new object model and dozens of new features that modernized the language.

During this period, PHP grew from being installed on 10% of web servers to becoming the dominant server-side language for web development.

#### Modern PHP: Version 7 and Beyond

After the abandoned plans for PHP 6 (which was to feature deep Unicode support), the language made significant leaps forward with PHP 7 and 8:

* **PHP 7.0 (2015)**: Featured Zend Engine 3.0 with dramatic performance improvements (up to twice as fast as PHP 5.6), consistent 64-bit support, the null coalescing operator (??), anonymous classes, and more.

* **PHP 7.x Series**: Subsequent releases added features like short list syntax (7.1), object parameter and return type declarations (7.2), new heredoc/nowdoc syntax (7.3), and typed properties (7.4).

* **PHP 8.0 (2020)**: Another major update introducing named arguments, union types, attributes, constructor property promotion, match expressions, the nullsafe operator (?->), and a new JIT compiler.

* **PHP 8.x Series**: Continued innovation with enumerations (8.1), fibers (8.1), readonly classes (8.2), and Disjunctive Normal Form types (8.2).

The latest version as of early 2025 is PHP 8.3, which will be supported until November 23, 2026.

#### PHP's Current Landscape

Today, PHP remains a dominant force in web development:

* **Market Share**: PHP powers approximately 75.9% of all websites whose server-side programming language is known.

* **Frameworks and Ecosystem**: The PHP ecosystem thrives with popular frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter, which have modernized PHP development practices.

* **Major Websites**: PHP is the backbone of major platforms including Facebook, WordPress, Wikipedia, Slack, Mailchimp, Tumblr, and Etsy.

* **WordPress Impact**: As the language behind WordPress (which powers over 40% of all websites), PHP's reach is enormous.

#### The Two Approaches to Modern PHP

The PHP community has evolved into two main camps:

1. **Traditional PHP**: Developers who adhere to PHP's original design philosophy, focusing on simplicity and rapid development.

2. **Object-Oriented PHP**: Developers who have embraced modern practices, frameworks, and object-oriented programming principles.

This division reflects PHP's unique position as a language that can be approached both as a simple scripting tool and as a robust platform for enterprise application development.

#### Current Trends and Future Direction

Several trends are shaping PHP's future:

* **Cloud Integration**: Businesses are increasingly combining PHP with cloud infrastructure to create scalable, flexible web solutions.

* **Mobile Responsiveness**: PHP developers are focusing on creating responsive applications for the mobile-first world.

* **AI and Chatbots**: PHP is being used to develop intelligent chatbots and AI-powered applications.

* **Performance Focus**: Each new version continues to emphasize performance improvements.

* **Type System Enhancements**: Recent versions have strengthened PHP's type system, making code more robust and maintainable.

PHP's continued evolution demonstrates its adaptability and the commitment of its development community to keeping the language relevant in the changing landscape of web development.

### PHP 8 Key Features and Improvements

PHP 8 represents one of the most significant updates in PHP's history, introducing numerous features that enhance developer productivity, improve code quality, and boost performance. Released in November 2020, PHP 8 brought fundamental changes to the language that have reshaped how developers write modern PHP code.

#### JIT Compiler

The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is perhaps the most technically significant addition to PHP 8:

* **Performance Boost**: The JIT compiler can provide substantial performance improvements for CPU-intensive operations by compiling parts of the code to machine code at runtime.

* **Implementation**: Built on top of the existing OPcache, the JIT compiler works by identifying frequently executed code paths and compiling them to native machine instructions.

* **Use Cases**: While not always beneficial for typical web requests (which are often I/O bound), the JIT compiler shines in computation-heavy applications, mathematical operations, and long-running processes.

```php
// CPU-intensive operations benefit most from JIT
function calculateFibonacci($n) {
    if ($n <= 1) return $n;
    return calculateFibonacci($n - 1) + calculateFibonacci($n - 2);
}

// With JIT enabled, this runs significantly faster
echo calculateFibonacci(30);
```

#### Named Arguments

Named arguments allow developers to pass values to a function by specifying the parameter name:

* **Improved Readability**: Makes function calls with many parameters more readable and self-documenting.

* **Selective Parameter Use**: Allows skipping optional parameters without using `null` placeholders.

* **Order Independence**: Parameters can be provided in any order when named.

```php
// Before PHP 8
htmlspecialchars($string, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_SUBSTITUTE, "UTF-8", false);

// With PHP 8 named arguments
htmlspecialchars(
    string: $string,
    flags: ENT_QUOTES | ENT_SUBSTITUTE,
    encoding: "UTF-8",
    double_encode: false
);

// Can skip optional parameters
htmlspecialchars(
    string: $string,
    double_encode: false
);
```

#### Union Types

Union types allow parameters and return values to accept values of multiple different types:

* **Type Safety**: Provides more precise type declarations while maintaining flexibility.

* **Reduced Boilerplate**: Eliminates the need for complex type checking in function bodies.

* **Better Documentation**: Makes the expected types explicit in the function signature.

```php
// Accept either an array or a Countable object
function count_items(array|Countable $items): int {
    return count($items);
}

// Return either a string or null
function fetch_data(string $url): string|null {
    // implementation
}
```

#### Match Expression

The match expression is an improved version of the switch statement:

* **Strict Comparison**: Uses strict equality (`===`) instead of loose equality (`==`).

* **Expression-Based**: Returns a value directly, unlike switch which requires explicit `return` statements.

* **No Fall-Through**: Each arm handles exactly one case without requiring `break` statements.

* **Exhaustiveness**: Throws an exception if no arm matches and no default is provided.

```php
// Old switch statement
switch ($status) {
    case 'draft':
        $statusText = 'Draft';
        break;
    case 'published':
        $statusText = 'Published';
        break;
    default:
        $statusText = 'Unknown';
}

// New match expression
$statusText = match ($status) {
    'draft' => 'Draft',
    'published' => 'Published',
    default => 'Unknown',
};
```

#### Constructor Property Promotion

Constructor property promotion reduces boilerplate code when defining class properties that are initialized through the constructor:

* **Concise Syntax**: Combines property declaration, constructor parameter, and property assignment in one line.

* **Reduced Repetition**: Eliminates the need to repeat property names in multiple places.

```php
// Before PHP 8
class User {
    private string $name;
    private int $age;
    private ?string $email;

    public function __construct(string $name, int $age, ?string $email = null) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
        $this->email = $email;
    }
}

// With PHP 8 constructor property promotion
class User {
    public function __construct(
        private string $name,
        private int $age,
        private ?string $email = null
    ) {}
}
```

#### Attributes (Annotations)

Attributes provide a native way to add metadata to classes, methods, properties, and more:

* **Native Implementation**: Replaces the docblock-based annotation systems used by many frameworks.

* **Type Safety**: Attributes are validated at compile time, unlike docblock annotations.

* **Reflection API**: Can be accessed at runtime through PHP's Reflection API.

```php
// Define an attribute
#[Attribute]
class Route {
    public function __construct(
        public string $path,
        public string $name = ''
    ) {}
}

// Use the attribute
class ProductController {
    #[Route('/products', 'product.index')]
    public function index() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

#### Nullsafe Operator

The nullsafe operator (`?->`) allows for safer chaining of method calls when dealing with potentially null values:

* **Null Propagation**: If any part of the chain evaluates to null, the entire expression returns null instead of raising an error.

* **Simplified Code**: Eliminates verbose null checking and conditional blocks.

```php
// Before PHP 8
$country = null;
if ($session !== null) {
    $user = $session->user;
    if ($user !== null) {
        $address = $user->getAddress();
        if ($address !== null) {
            $country = $address->country;
        }
    }
}

// With PHP 8 nullsafe operator
$country = $session?->user?->getAddress()?->country;
```

#### Other Notable Improvements

PHP 8 introduced several other important features and improvements:

* **Consistent Type Errors**: Improved type error messages and consistency across the language.

* **New `str_contains()`, `str_starts_with()`, and `str_ends_with()` Functions**: Simplified string operations that were previously verbose.

* **Weak Maps**: Allow storing references to objects without preventing garbage collection.

* **Throw Expression**: The `throw` keyword can now be used as an expression.

* **Static Return Type**: Methods can now declare that they return an instance of the same class.

* **Mixed Type**: A new `mixed` type was added to indicate that a parameter or return value can be of any type.

* **Trailing Comma in Parameter Lists**: Allows adding a comma after the last parameter in function declarations.

#### Performance Improvements

Beyond the JIT compiler, PHP 8 includes numerous performance optimizations:

* **Improved Type System**: More efficient internal handling of types.

* **Optimized Standard Library**: Many core functions were rewritten for better performance.

* **Reduced Memory Usage**: More efficient internal data structures.

* **Faster Method Calls**: Optimized calling conventions for object methods.

These improvements collectively make PHP 8 significantly faster than previous versions, with benchmarks showing 10-20% performance gains even without the JIT compiler.

#### Migration Considerations

When upgrading to PHP 8, developers should be aware of:

* **Backward Compatibility Breaks**: PHP 8 includes several backward-incompatible changes.

* **Deprecated Features**: Some features were deprecated and will be removed in future versions.

* **New Error Handling**: Previously silent errors may now throw exceptions.

* **Framework Compatibility**: Ensure that frameworks and libraries are compatible with PHP 8.

PHP 8 represents a major step forward in PHP's evolution, bringing it closer to modern programming language standards while maintaining its accessibility and web-centric focus.

### Setting Up a Professional Development Environment

Setting up a professional development environment is crucial for PHP developers who want to work efficiently, maintain code quality, and collaborate effectively with others. A well-configured environment helps streamline your workflow, catch errors early, and ensure your code works consistently across different systems.

#### Choosing Your Operating System

Your choice of operating system will influence your development workflow:

* **Linux**: Many PHP developers prefer Linux (particularly Ubuntu or Debian) because most production servers run Linux. This creates parity between development and production environments.

* **macOS**: Offers a Unix-based system with excellent developer tools and a polished user interface. PHP comes pre-installed, though you'll want to update it.

* **Windows**: With tools like WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), Windows has become more viable for PHP development, though you may encounter occasional compatibility issues.

The most important consideration is choosing a system you're comfortable with while ensuring it can closely match your production environment.

#### Essential Components of a PHP Development Environment

##### 1. PHP Installation

Install the PHP version that matches your production environment. Consider using version managers like `phpenv` or `php-version` to easily switch between PHP versions for different projects:

```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php8.2 php8.2-cli php8.2-common php8.2-curl php8.2-mbstring php8.2-mysql php8.2-xml php8.2-zip

# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install php@8.2
```

##### 2. Web Server

You'll need a web server to process PHP files. Options include:

* **Apache**: The most widely used web server for PHP
* **Nginx**: Offers better performance for static content
* **Built-in PHP Server**: For quick development (`php -S localhost:8000`)

##### 3. Database

Most PHP applications require a database:

* **MySQL/MariaDB**: The traditional choice for PHP applications
* **PostgreSQL**: A powerful alternative with advanced features
* **SQLite**: Lightweight option for simple applications or testing

##### 4. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

A good IDE dramatically improves productivity:

* **PhpStorm**: The most comprehensive PHP IDE with advanced features like intelligent code completion, debugging, and testing tools
* **Visual Studio Code**: A lightweight, extensible editor with excellent PHP support through extensions
* **Sublime Text**: A fast, customizable editor popular among developers

##### 5. Package Manager

Composer is essential for modern PHP development:

```bash
# Install Composer globally
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

This allows you to easily manage dependencies and follow modern PHP practices.

#### All-in-One Development Solutions

For beginners or those who prefer simplicity, consider using pre-configured development environments:

* **Laravel Homestead**: A pre-packaged Vagrant box with everything needed for Laravel development
* **Docker with PHP containers**: Create consistent, isolated environments
* **XAMPP/MAMP/WAMP**: All-in-one packages for Windows, macOS, or Linux

#### Version Control Setup

Git is essential for professional PHP development:

```bash
# Install Git
sudo apt install git  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install git      # macOS

# Configure Git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Connect to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to store your repositories and collaborate with others.

#### Development Workflow Tools

##### 1. Task Runners and Build Tools

Tools like Gulp, Webpack, or npm scripts help automate repetitive tasks:

```bash
# Install Node.js and npm
sudo apt install nodejs npm  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install node           # macOS

# Install Gulp globally
npm install -g gulp
```

##### 2. Linters and Code Quality Tools

Maintain code quality with tools like:

* **PHP_CodeSniffer**: Enforces coding standards
* **PHPStan**: Static analysis tool
* **PHP Mess Detector**: Identifies potential problems

```bash
# Install via Composer
composer global require squizlabs/php_codesniffer
composer global require phpstan/phpstan
```

##### 3. Debugging Tools

Effective debugging is crucial:

* **Xdebug**: The standard PHP debugger
* **PHP Debug Bar**: Visual debugging for web applications

```bash
# Install Xdebug
sudo apt install php8.2-xdebug  # Ubuntu/Debian
pecl install xdebug            # macOS
```

#### Local Development Best Practices

##### 1. Match Production Environment

Your development environment should mirror production as closely as possible to avoid "works on my machine" problems. Consider using Docker to create identical environments.

##### 2. Use Virtual Hosts

Configure virtual hosts to work with multiple projects:

```apache
# Example Apache virtual host
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName myproject.local
    DocumentRoot /path/to/project/public
    <Directory /path/to/project/public>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

##### 3. Local SSL Setup

Develop with HTTPS locally to match production security:

```bash
# Generate self-signed certificate
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myproject.key -out myproject.crt
```

##### 4. Environment-Specific Configuration

Use `.env` files to manage environment-specific configuration:

```
# .env example
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=myapp
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

#### Testing Environment

Set up a comprehensive testing environment:

* **PHPUnit**: For unit and integration testing
* **Behat**: For behavior-driven development
* **Selenium**: For browser automation testing

```bash
# Install PHPUnit
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit

# Create a basic phpunit.xml configuration
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php" colors="true">
    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="Application Test Suite">
            <directory>tests</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>
</phpunit>
```

#### Continuous Integration Setup

Integrate with CI/CD services:

* **GitHub Actions**: Automate testing and deployment
* **Jenkins**: Self-hosted CI server
* **Travis CI/CircleCI**: Cloud-based CI services

#### Documentation Tools

Document your code and APIs:

* **PHPDocumentor**: Generate documentation from docblocks
* **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Document APIs

#### Keeping Your Environment Updated

Regularly update your tools and dependencies:

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew update && brew upgrade          # macOS

# Update Composer packages
composer update

# Update npm packages
npm update
```

#### Security Considerations

* Keep PHP and all dependencies updated
* Use HTTPS locally
* Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
* Follow security best practices in your code

#### Conclusion

A professional PHP development environment combines the right tools, configurations, and practices to maximize productivity and code quality. While setting up such an environment requires initial investment, the benefits in terms of efficiency, collaboration, and code quality are substantial.

Remember that your development environment should evolve with your needs and the technologies you use. Regularly evaluate new tools and approaches that might improve your workflow, and don't hesitate to customize your environment to match your specific requirements and preferences.

### Composer and Package Management

Composer has revolutionized PHP development by introducing a standardized approach to dependency management. This powerful tool allows developers to declare, manage, and install the libraries their projects depend on, making modern PHP development more efficient and maintainable.

#### What is Composer?

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP, similar to npm for JavaScript or pip for Python. Created by Nils Adermann and Jordi Boggiano in 2012, it has become an essential tool in the PHP ecosystem.

Key characteristics of Composer include:

* **Project-based**: Manages dependencies on a per-project basis
* **Declarative**: Dependencies are specified in a configuration file
* **Deterministic**: Ensures consistent installations across different environments
* **Autoloading**: Automatically generates PSR-compliant autoloaders

#### Installing Composer

Installing Composer is straightforward across different operating systems:

**For Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

**For Windows:**
Download and run the Composer-Setup.exe installer from the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

Verify your installation with:
```bash
composer --version
```

#### Understanding composer.json

The `composer.json` file is the heart of Composer's functionality. It defines:

* Project metadata
* Required dependencies and version constraints
* Development dependencies
* Autoloading configuration
* Scripts for automation

A basic `composer.json` file might look like this:

```json
{
    "name": "vendor/project",
    "description": "A short description of the project",
    "type": "project",
    "require": {
        "php": ">=8.1",
        "monolog/monolog": "^2.8",
        "symfony/http-foundation": "^6.2"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "phpunit/phpunit": "^9.5"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "src/"
        }
    },
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Your Name",
            "email": "your.email@example.com"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Version Constraints

Composer uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for dependency management. Understanding version constraints is crucial:

* **Exact version**: `"monolog/monolog": "2.8.0"`
* **Range**: `"monolog/monolog": ">=2.8.0 <3.0.0"`
* **Wildcard**: `"monolog/monolog": "2.8.*"`
* **Tilde**: `"monolog/monolog": "~2.8"` (>=2.8.0 <3.0.0)
* **Caret**: `"monolog/monolog": "^2.8"` (>=2.8.0 <3.0.0)

The caret (`^`) is most commonly used as it follows semantic versioning principles, allowing non-breaking updates.

#### Essential Composer Commands

Mastering these commands will help you manage dependencies effectively:

**Initialize a new project:**
```bash
composer init
```

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
composer install
```

**Update dependencies:**
```bash
composer update
```

**Add a new dependency:**
```bash
composer require vendor/package
```

**Add a development dependency:**
```bash
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
```

**Remove a dependency:**
```bash
composer remove vendor/package
```

**Show installed packages:**
```bash
composer show
```

**Validate composer.json:**
```bash
composer validate
```

**Create optimized autoloader:**
```bash
composer dump-autoload -o
```

#### Understanding composer.lock

The `composer.lock` file is automatically generated when you run `composer install` or `composer update`. It:

* Records the exact versions of all installed packages
* Ensures consistent installations across different environments
* Should be committed to version control

When you run `composer install` with an existing `composer.lock` file, Composer will install the exact versions specified in the lock file, ensuring consistency.

#### Autoloading

One of Composer's most powerful features is its ability to generate autoloaders that follow PSR-4 or other standards:

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        "App\\": "src/"
    },
    "files": [
        "src/helpers.php"
    ],
    "classmap": [
        "database/seeds",
        "database/factories"
    ]
}
```

After changing autoload configuration, regenerate the autoloader:
```bash
composer dump-autoload
```

#### Private Packages and Repositories

Composer can work with private packages through several methods:

**Private Packagist:**
```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://repo.packagist.com/company/"
    }
]
```

**VCS Repository:**
```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/company/private-repo"
    }
]
```

**Path Repository (local packages):**
```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "../packages/*"
    }
]
```

#### Scripts and Automation

Composer scripts allow you to automate common tasks:

```json
"scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "php artisan optimize"
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "php artisan clear-compiled",
        "php artisan optimize"
    ],
    "test": "phpunit",
    "cs-fix": "php-cs-fixer fix"
}
```

Run scripts with:
```bash
composer test
composer cs-fix
```

#### Packagist: The PHP Package Repository

[Packagist](https://packagist.org/) is the main Composer repository, containing thousands of PHP packages. To publish your own package:

1. Create a `composer.json` file in your project
2. Push your code to a public Git repository (typically GitHub)
3. Submit your package on Packagist.org

#### Creating Your Own Packages

To create a reusable package:

1. Structure your code following PSR standards
2. Create a comprehensive `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "name": "your-vendor/package-name",
    "description": "Description of your package",
    "type": "library",
    "license": "MIT",
    "authors": [
        {
            "name": "Your Name",
            "email": "your.email@example.com"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "php": ">=8.1"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "YourVendor\\PackageName\\": "src/"
        }
    }
}
```

3. Add tests, documentation, and a README
4. Publish to Packagist

#### Best Practices for Dependency Management

Follow these practices for effective package management:

* **Lock your dependencies**: Always commit `composer.lock` to version control
* **Use semantic versioning**: Follow SemVer when creating packages
* **Specify PHP version**: Always include PHP version requirements
* **Minimize dependencies**: Only require what you need
* **Update regularly**: Keep dependencies updated for security fixes
* **Use development dependencies**: Separate production and development dependencies
* **Optimize for production**: Use `--no-dev` and `-o` flags in production

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

#### Security Considerations

Composer provides tools to help manage security:

**Check for vulnerable dependencies:**
```bash
composer audit
```

**Update a specific package for security:**
```bash
composer update monolog/monolog --with-dependencies
```

#### Composer in CI/CD Pipelines

Integrate Composer in your CI/CD workflows:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: PHP CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: '8.2'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: composer install --prefer-dist --no-progress
      - name: Run tests
        run: composer test
```

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Memory limits**: Increase PHP memory limit with `COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1`
* **Timeout issues**: Increase timeout with `COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT=2000`
* **Dependency conflicts**: Use `composer why-not package/name` to understand conflicts
* **Autoloader problems**: Regenerate with `composer dump-autoload -o`
* **Rate limiting**: Use a GitHub token with `composer config -g github-oauth.github.com YOUR_TOKEN`

#### Beyond Basic Usage

Advanced Composer features include:

* **Multi-package repositories**: Manage multiple packages in a single repository
* **Custom installers**: Create custom installation paths for specific package types
* **Plugin system**: Extend Composer's functionality with plugins
